## 4. How to Make This Shine on Your GitHub Profile

1. **Pin the repo**  
   - Go to your GitHub profile → “Customize your pins” → Pin this repo so it shows on your front page.

2. **Add a short “why this matters” line to your profile README (if you have one):**

   > `azure-static-resume-site` – my resume hosted on Azure Storage, fronted by Azure CDN & DNS with custom SSL. A small site with real-world cloud architecture decisions.

3. **Use this repo as a reference link on:**
   - LinkedIn “Featured” section
   - Resume (Projects section)
   - Upwork / Fiverr profiles
